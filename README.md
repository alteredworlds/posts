To build this project, you'll need Android Studio 3.0 Beta 7 (or better)


You'll also need  JetBrains' Kotlin plugin v1.1.51-Studio3.0-1


Clone this repo and then open for the first time using Android Studio's 'Import project'.


Uses MVVM pattern, Data Binding, RxJava2, Dagger2, android-dagger.

Doesn't currently use Google's ViewModel; my design pre-dates the release of this component.
